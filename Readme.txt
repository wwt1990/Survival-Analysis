In the project, we sampled the on-screen movies of different genre from Oct 2012 to Oct. 2013 in order to analyze the time to the achievement of 50 million dollars since a movieâ€™s release date. The factors affecting survival time is gross, budget, genre, month released, IMDB rating. Several survival analysis techniques were made use of in this commercial investigation. In the first section of our report, we illustrated the Kaplan-Meier estimator, the median survival time, the log-rank and weighted log-rank tests, and the second section takes up the Cox proportional-hazards model with time-independent covariates and residuals for accessing model adequacy. The conclusion is that the main factors that influences movie gross are genre and month.
